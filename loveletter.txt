
My beautiful Princess

Can u believe its already been a whole month since we started our beautiful relationship together. Time really flies by fast when u spend it with ur most favorite person, yet every little memory we have shared together is so precious and dar to me. We started talking 4 months ago, joked around a lot, stayed up and ruined our sleep for eachother and simply connected. I didnt even know ur real name neither did I know what u looked like and yet I was still drawn to you, thats the moment I realized that I fell in love with you Kayleigh <3. We talked more, were on calls for hours and hours almost everyday. I love your voice, it warms and heals my heart and makes me smile whenever I hear you. You are so much on my mind that I started having dreams about you. There will be times where we'll have our disagreements and arguments, but as long as we have eachother I believe we'll overcome any obstacle coming our way together. I'll try my best to better myself and improve for you in the areas that Im struggling with. Now I just want to thank you for being an amazing person, thank you for ur beautiful heart, thank you for being mine, thank you for loving me and thank you for being there for me. So here's to us, my love, adn to the beautiful future we'll have together. Thank you for being the most wonderful partner anyone could ever ask for. I love you Kayleigh so much and will always love you forever. You are engraved in my heart my love and mean the world to me ;3

I love you Kayleigh <3

Your love
